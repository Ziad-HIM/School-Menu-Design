# School-Menu-Design
What a tasty looking menu!
This is a school menu, organized by days of the week, from Sunday to Thursday. Each day offers two meal options, along with the calorie count for each dish. The menu also includes a choice of flavored milk or water as a beverage. The design is vibrant and visually engaging, featuring food illustrations such as burgers, wraps, pasta, and a milk carton at the bottom.
